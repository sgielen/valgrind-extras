These are my extra files for sane and easy use of Valgrind. To start, copy the
rc file to your ~/.valgrindrc and change the paths to the supplement files. You
can also move the file as ".valgrindrc" into the directory where you call
valgrind. For more info on the RC file, see
http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/manual-core.html#manual-core.defopts. For more
information on the supplement files, see Valgrind's manpage. Run valgrind with
the -v flag to check how often supplement files were used.

Pull requests welcome!
